üìú **Project Description**  
        The SMS Spam Detection System is a machine learning-powered web application designed to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Not Spam. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques, this system provides a quick and efficient way to filter unwanted messages.

        üöÄ **Key Features**  
        - **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive user experience.  
        - **Text Preprocessing**: Implements tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming for effective text analysis.  
        - **Accurate Predictions**: Trained using advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver precise classifications.  
        - **Real-Time Processing**: Instantly predicts the nature of an SMS after user input.  

        ‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**  
        - **Programming Language**: Python  
        - **Frameworks and Libraries**:  
            - **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.  
            - **NLTK**: For text preprocessing.  
            - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.  
        - **Tools**:  
            - **Pickle**: For saving and loading pre-trained models and vectorizers.  

        üí° **How It Works**  
        - **Input**: Users provide an SMS message through the web interface.  
        - **Text Transformation**: The input text undergoes preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, removal of stopwords, and stemming).  
        - **Vectorization**: The processed text is converted into numerical features using a pre-trained vectorizer.  
        - **Prediction**: A machine learning model classifies the message as Spam or Not Spam.  
        - **Output**: The result is displayed on the interface with a clear visual cue.  

        üìà **Applications**  
        - SMS filtering for personal or enterprise-level communication.  
        - Reducing unwanted promotional or phishing messages.  
        - Enhancing productivity by managing text-based communications effectively.  

        üõ† **Future Enhancements**  
        - Support for multiple languages in SMS detection.  
        - Mobile-friendly responsive design.  
        - Integration with email and messaging platforms.
